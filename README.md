## Introduction
React is a powerful, component-based, tool that streamlines the process of developing clean readable website code! And through the use of [React Hooks][1], developers can easily add and create additional functionalities which aren't already in React! Statefully abstracts the unnecessary details of setting and updating state away so you can make simple read/write operations without having to worry about properly updating your state.

## Getting Started
To get started, install statefully in your project.

```
npm i statefully
```
